Generic Blog engine, currently in use by [blog.crowdint.com](http://blog.crowdint.com)
and [crowdint.com/careers](http://crowdint.com/careers), among others.

## Installation

Gemfile

    gem 'crowdblog'

Bundle

    bundle install

Copy migrations

    rake crowdblog:install:migrations

Run them

    rake db:migrate

Mount

    #
    # routes.rb
    #

    mount Crowdblog::Engine => '/blog_admin'

Enjoy.

Your Rails App should implement the "client facing" pages. Read posts from the
Crowdblog::Post model.

### Authentication

The gem includes a very basic Devise implementation. We use it in combination
with [this gem](https://github.com/crowdint/crowdint_auth) to authenticate
via our Google Apps accounts.

Take a look [at this code](https://github.com/crowdint/blog.crowdint.com) as an implementation example.

## Testing: Use with caution

If you are using it as a 'vanilla' installation, that is, without a lot of
customizations, you can use some specs that are included with the gem to make
sure your blog behaves properly.

Add this on your spec_helper, right after you require `rspec/rails`:

    require 'crowdblog/rspec'
    require 'database_cleaner'

Your are going to need DatabaseCleaner to use truncation strategies for your
data. Add these lines to spec_helper.rb:

    Rspec.configure do |config|

      config.use_transactional_fixtures = false

      config.before(:suite) do
        DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation
        DatabaseCleaner.clean_with(:truncation)
      end

      config.before(:each) do
        DatabaseCleaner.start
      end

      config.after(:each) do
        DatabaseCleaner.clean
      end
    end

Now, create a crowdblog spec:

    #
    # spec/integration/crowdblog_spec.rb
    #
    require 'spec_helper'

    describe "Crowdblog" do
      it_behaves_like "a crowdblog"
    end

And run your specs. It should test Crowdblog properly.
